# CMPG_323_Project_2_-_34729100
In this project I am expected to create an API for managing IoT Devices. The API will be created using visual studio .NET core and will be tested using Swagger.
## Project progress 
### 30/08/22
Today I will be creating my Azure database and connecting it to my API.
> I created my Azure database but failed to connect it to my API. I will go do reseach and ask some questions and try again another day.

Late update - On Saturday 27/08/22 I made a local database and created a simple API to see how everything works. I also created a resource group on MS Azure and tried to create the database, but I ran into some problems. Unfortunately, I forgot to update my readme.
### 01/09/22
Today I will be reattempting to connect my Azure database to my API.
